\section*{Conclusion}

In this article, we have shown how proximal splitting schemes offer an elegant and unifying framework to describe computational methods to solve the dynamical optimal transport with an Eulerian discretization. This allowed use to extend the original method of Benamou and Brenier in several directions, most notably the use of staggered grid discretization and the introduction of generalized, spatially variant, cost functions.
